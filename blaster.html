      <h1>Blaster</h1>
      <p> Blaster was a large black and yellow Slizer.
      <p> He is believed to be the result of <a href="amazon.html">Amazon</a> and <a href="jet.html">Jet</a> being fused together and mutated by the Meteor,
          as suggested by his faceplate and colours.
      <p> He could be combined with <a href="spark.html">Spark</a> and <a href="flare.html">Flare</a> to form <a href="dynamo.html">Dynamo</a>.
